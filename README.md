# Chatbot Smart Widget UI (Angular)

With the chatbot smart widget you can simply implement a chatbot in any page.

You will also need the BFF package in order to get the chatbot smart widget to work: [http://github.com/TriangleJuice/chatbot_service_nodejs](http://github.com/TriangleJuice/chatbot_service_nodejs)

There is a demo app, see below for instructions on running it.

## How to use

### Installing

```sh
> npm install @acpaas-ui-widgets/ngx-chatbot
```

Import the component in your module:

```ts
@NgModule({
  imports: [
    ...,
    ChatbotModule
  ],
  ...
})
```

In the index.html, include the core branding stylesheet:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.antwerpen.be/core_branding_scss/3.0.3/main.min.css">
```

> For projects that are still using Angular 5, we are [maintaining a v1 branch](https://github.com/digipolisantwerp/chatbot_widget_angular/tree/v1), which will still receive bug fixes if needed.

```sh
> npm install @acpaas-ui-widgets/ngx-chatbot@"<2.0.0
```

### In your template

```html
<aui-chatbot
  url="http://localhost:3000/api/bff"
  session="123456789"
  title="My chatbot"
  placeholder="Type your message hereâ€¦"
  [pinned]="false"
  [delay]="200"
  [height]="400">
</aui-chatbot>
```

### Supported attributes

#### **url**
`string` BFF URL.

#### **session**
`string` Required session ID for the chatbot engine, where each chat conversation is linked to its chat session. It's important to use a unique id, since all session data, like answers already given, are stored in the chatbot engine.

#### **title**
`string` Title above the chat window.

#### **pinned**
`boolean` Whether the chatbot is inline or pinned to the bottom of the application.

#### **placeholder**
`string` Placeholder string in the chat input field.

#### **delay**
`number` Delay between multiple messages received from the chatbot engine.

#### **height**

## Run the demo app

```sh
> npm install
> npm start
```

Browse to [localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200)

To use the chatbot widget, you will need to have also started the corresponding back-end service.
